# Boxing

I used to be pretty bad at football – or soccer, for those of you overseas. My legs didn't coordinate well enough to drive the ball where I wanted it, so I often found myself in the goalkeeper position.

When it came to cycling, I was average. The simplicity of the exercise appealed to me. Navigating open spaces came easily, but I lacked the endurance required for longer distances. Additionally, I didn't have the funds for a top-tier bike and equipment. In my prime, I recall going on 60 km. trips with friends. Yet, any dedicated cyclist can tackle 100 km. without much strain. I vividly remember the exhaustion at the end of those journeys, with shaky legs and an unquenchable thirst.

Then, I ventured into running. It's affordable and uncomplicated. My body adapted to the rhythm of running rather swiftly. At around 25, I ran 6 km every day. These days, I manage 8 km three times a week. My pace isn't record-breaking, but it's respectable. Most of the time, I run solo, which allows my thoughts to drift. It's as though my body goes on auto-pilot, letting me reflect on day-to-day challenges. I don't detest running, but it leans more towards the monotonous side of sports for me.

Boxing, however, occupies a unique space in my heart. It demands undivided attention, adaptability, technical prowess, stamina, and power. While it's less pricey than cycling, there's still some investment needed, particularly in gloves and shoes. There's a quote from the movie *Million Dollar Baby* that resonates with me:

```
Boxing is an unnatural act. Because everything in it is backwards. You want to move to the left, you don’t step left; you push on the right toe. To move right, you use your left toe. Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do, you step into it. Everything in boxing is backwards.
```

I believe this captures the essence of boxing. Boxing, like other combat sports, is essentially a regulated form of primal aggression. The very act of fighting another of your kind for the amusement of onlookers is both absurd and captivating.
