Hello, everyone! Welcome to my new blog, **Lemniscata 2023**.

I've created this website using a Python script that I developed to transform Markdown files into static HTML pages. The script takes advantage of [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates and the [Python Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) library. If you're curious about how it works or want to create your own static blog, feel free to check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/idaho06/lemniscata2023).

I plan to update this blog regularly, sharing my thoughts, experiences, and projects. As someone who has been using social media platforms like Twitter and Mastodon, I've noticed a growing dissatisfaction with the recent changes in Twitter's moderation policies. I've decided to return to a more classic blog format as a way to express myself more freely and in a longer format.

This blog will serve as an extension to my posts on Mastodon and Twitter, allowing me to dive deeper into topics and provide more context than a single tweet or toot can offer. I believe that engaging in longer-form content can foster more thoughtful discussions and create a space where ideas can be explored in more detail.

So, welcome to **Lemniscata 2023**! I'm excited to share this journey with you, and I hope you'll find my posts informative and thought-provoking. Stay tuned for more updates, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
