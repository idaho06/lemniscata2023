# My Journey into 3D Computer Graphics Programming

The first time I saw something similar to a full immersive 3D experience was in a friend's house, Id's [Wolfenstein 3D](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Wolfenstein_3D_1992) running on a huge IBM-compatible 386 tower. It was incredible. And I think that was the first time I thought, "I want to program something like that."

Some time later, I remember finding a Basic program that used polar coordinates to draw a 3D wireframe cube. Was it a book or a magazine? I can't recall. But I'm sure I translated the program to a pirated [Turbo Pascal 5](https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/lang/borland/pascal/5.00/) and created an MS-DOS exe file that ran pretty fast! I showed it to some friends and a teacher in the informatics academy near my neighborhood, and the response was always positive. Inside me, I knew I couldn't explain how the program worked.

Some years ago, I became unemployed. I found the [Irrlicht engine](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/) and started my most ambitious project to date: Formula Retro. It's a homage to Sega's Virtua Racing. My idea was to create an arcade game similar to it, but doubling the number of faces and resolution. With the help of @Ruben3D, I managed to create a car, put it on a track, and drive it.

All the graphics math was still handled by the engine, but I had to learn a bit of trigonometry and algebra. Sadly, I ran out of money, so I took a job and stopped developing the game.

Recently, I found Pikuma's course for [3D Computer Graphics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming) and Gabriel Gambetta's [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/). I also started learning Rust programming, and with the combination of these three things, I started my [own software renderer](https://github.com/idaho06/renderer3d.rust).
