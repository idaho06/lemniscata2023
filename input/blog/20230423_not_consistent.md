# To be consistent

It's been a month since my last post, where I shared my journey in implementing mesh and face clipping functionality for my 3D renderer project in Rust. Truth be told, I barely started working on that task. Procrastination and fatigue have been constant companions, making it difficult for me to maintain consistency.

## Jerry Seinfeld's "Don't Break the Chain" Method

I remember learning about the comedian [Jerry Seinfeld's method called "don't break the chain."](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy) It's a simple technique where you mark a calendar every day you work on a task, creating a chain of markings to visualize your progress. The goal is to keep the chain unbroken, thus encouraging consistency and discipline.

But lately, I've been struggling to keep my chain intact.

To add to my frustration, I made a promise to a friend that I would help him create a new video game. Unfortunately, I've been swamped with work and trying to finish my 3D engine, leaving little time for this new commitment.

I know that this is my spare time and I can do whatever I want with it, including not programming. But I canâ€™t help it and feel bad. I want to enjoy blogging and coding, but I also want to see results and achievements. I want to overcome this slump and get back on track.
